"""Low-level danbooru tag-*shape* primitives — the single source of truth.

These recognize the *form* of a tag (artist ``@``-prefix, count tag, raw rating
literal) without any vocab or model. They are shared by every consumer that
types tags so the two categorization paths can't silently drift:

* the Anima Tagger vocab build — ``scripts/anima_tagger/vocab.py::categorize``
  (image→tag model's view of the corpus), and
* the dataset caption index — ``scripts/preprocess/build_caption_index.py``
  (method-agnostic typed-tag index for identity pairing / analytics).

Pure stdlib by design: importing this must NOT pull in torch. The richer,
*content*-aware heuristics (vocab-membership classification, danbooru
``name (series)`` paren recovery, positional bare-name recovery) stay with the
caption-index builder — they exist to compensate for the tagger's frozen vocab
and have no model-side counterpart.
